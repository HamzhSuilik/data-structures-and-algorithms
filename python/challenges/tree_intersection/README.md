# Challenge Summary
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
return a set of values found in both

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
Time --> (2n)
space --> (n)

## Solution
write function that travel inside the trees using preOrder method , and save the numbers of the first tree in hash map , then check if any number of hash map is match with tree 2 , finally return array of the matched values found in both trees
