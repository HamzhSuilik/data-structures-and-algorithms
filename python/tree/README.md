# Trees
**Binary Trees**
data structure contains Node can hold only tow child : lift , right . every childe has one parent .

**Binary Search Trees**
In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right


## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.


## Approach & Efficiency
Big O :
**Binary Trees**
Time -> (n)
Space -> (n)
**Binary Search Trees**
Time -> (log n)
Space -> (1)

## API
- TNode class with right , lift and value variables
- Binary Trees class with preOrder , inOrder and postOrder functions to traversal through tree
- Binary Search Trees : add and function to add new values where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right
