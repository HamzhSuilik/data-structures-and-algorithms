# Challenge Summary
In a depth first traversal we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO :
Time : O(n)
Space : O(n)

## Solution
- the depth first travels need Stack because the Stack principle is First In Last Out , so I use a Stack data structure to order the graph nodes before adding the to the result list
- and it is important to use a visited list , to prevent re cycle in the graph
