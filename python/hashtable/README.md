# Hashtables
Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.
used to  store the key as hashed key into this data structure

## Challenge
create Hashtable class to store the values with hashed key using methods : add , get , hash , contains

## Approach & Efficiency
Big (O):
Time -> O(1)
Space -> O(n)

## API
- Linked list : a data structure for storing the data in the linked node based on FILO
- add : add new value to the hashtable class with hashed key
- get : return the stored values based on the input key
- hash : hash the key in to numerical number valid to use as index
- contains : check if there any value in the input key location
